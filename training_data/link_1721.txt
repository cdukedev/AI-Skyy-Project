	Dear MDC Family,

	As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, I am filled with gratitude and appreciation for each and every member of our Miami Dade College community. This is a time when we come together to reflect on the blessings that surround us, and give thanks to the remarkable achievements weâve been able to accomplish together. Our students, world-class faculty and staff truly make Miami Dade College a vibrant place of learning and growth, and it is through your passion and commitment to excellence that weâve been able to create an environment that fosters innovation and provides opportunities for everyone in our community.

	Together, we have much to be thankful for, and I look forward to continue collaborating as we stay committed to reaching even greater heights as an institution. May the start of this holiday season be a beautiful reminder of all the wonderful things in life, and may you find time to connect with those who mean the most to you as you gather around the table. However, as we gather to celebrate and give thanks, let us also take a moment to acknowledge those who may have an empty chair at their table this Thanksgiving. We extend our thoughts and prayers to all those who may be experiencing a sense of loss during this holiday season and hope they find peace and comfort during this time.

	Wishing you and your loved ones a joyful and restful Thanksgiving break filled with reflection, connection and gratitude.



	With sincere appreciation,



	Madeline
