Drs. Karen Alvarez-Delfin (Biology),  Victoria Castells (Chemistry) and Gregory Smith (Chemistry) lead the Campus'  authentic scientific research lab experience offered in collaboration with the  University of Miami's Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Students work in  research teams, and each team develops its own scientific research project. Students  design their experiments based on information obtained from scientific  peer-reviewed journals. Students collect and analyze the data of the  experiments and prepare a scientific poster presented at the annual student  symposium at the University of Miami. For more information on the authentic  research lab experience, please contact Dr. Alvarez-Delfin at kalvare2@mdc.edu;  Dr. Castells at vcastel1@mdc.edu;  or gsmith3@mdc.edu.
