The EAP Program is divided into six levels: beginning through advanced. Each level consists of classes 
            in grammar, writing, reading and speaking/listening. Students are also required to take a writing lab and 
            speaking/listening lab at each level. 
            
Students wishing to enroll in the program take a placement test (ACTE COMPASS/ESL) and do a writing 
            sample to assess language proficiency. The student is placed in the appropriate level based on the 
            results of these assessments. Students in Levels 5 or 6 have the possibility of taking two accent 
            reduction courses to further improve their speaking skills through a focus on pronunciation. Academic 
            support is provided through the speech and writing labs, which are an integral part of the program.
