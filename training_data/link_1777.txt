Professor Sherri Sinkoff and Professor Mariana Molina launched the  "Global Citizen Project", an interdisciplinary project in which students have  excelled. Dr. Molina's Psychology students conducted research on various topics  about food insecurity, including how food insecurity across college campuses  impacts students' academic performance and mental health. Prof. Sinkoff's  public speaking students collaborate with the psychology students and analyze  the research to create comprehensive presentations, including blogs that were  delivered to various classes and shared as part of the MDC Empowered program.  Students from both courses also collected donations for the Hialeah campus's  Food Pantry and help raise awareness of this resource for students and staff throughout  the semester, culminating with a co-curricular service-learning event,  "Let's Fight Food Insecurity."
