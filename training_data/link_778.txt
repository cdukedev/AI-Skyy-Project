Welcome to Miami Dade College- Hialeah Campus Student Services.  Here at the Hialeah Campus, you will discover a variety of ways to integrate your classroom learning with college experiences outside the classroom, all which increase your opportunities for intellectual, personal, and social growth.  Our hope is that this will be a transformational time for you; that you will learn not only what is necessary to earn your degree, but also a broader knowledge and understanding of yourself, your community, and the world.
