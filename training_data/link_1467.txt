Mathematics Success and Emotional Intelligence

The Teaching and Learning Center (TLC) enhances educational development at Wolfson Campus to equitably improve pedagogy for our diverse student body. A hub and incubator for faculty and staff, the TLC provides space, training, and support to promote effective, inclusive, and equitable teaching and learning. TLC seeks to innovate and invigorate learning to adapt to and address students’ needs.
1. Quality Matters Course Certification – Promotes best practices in online learning by supporting faculty to achieve the highest national standards in course design. While all online and blended courses may receive QM certification, the TLC will give priority to mathematics courses. You can demonstrate your commitment to quality and continuous improvement by participating in the process of having a course QM certified. The TLC will assist by pairing you with an Instructional Designer.
QM Certified Courses follow the below rubric of General Standards:
2. Faculty Learning Communities – Foster intellectual community and drive change in instructional approaches to enhance student learning through the establishment of Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs)
3. Professional Development Workshops – Develop a cadre of faculty experts at Wolfson Campus through professional development opportunities, offered in partnership with MDC’s Center for Institutional and Organizational Learning (CIOL). Please check back for future upcoming opportunities.
