Surveys are the most common method of obtaining feedback and assessing the experiences, opinions, and educational needs of those who attend Miami Dade College. They have been successfully used to produce important curricular and co-curricular information about student learning and educational experiences
Many surveys are administered at MDC, among the most prominent being those that assess feedback, student engagement, faculty perceptions, and graduate/alumni experiences. Information about recurring surveys administered by Miami Dade College's Division of Institutional Effectiveness can be found on this site.
