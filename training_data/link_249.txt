Student and Teacher Integrated Center For Health Sciences
STICHES is a Title V grant designed to support and empower students pursuing pathways in the health sciences by improving access to critical academic and vocational resources, elevating the student experience on and off campus, and enhancing teaching and learning through collaboration with college faculty and local secondary school teachers.
According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in healthcare occupations is projected to grow 16% from 2020 to 2030 – a rate that outpaces the average for all occupations. In 2019, the median salary for healthcare industry jobs was between $28,000 and $75,000 per year and it continues to increase. Miami-Dade County alone has 14 major hospitals, 3 of which are located near Kendall Campus.
The STICHES grant is funded by the United States Department of Education. Award No. P031S200185.
