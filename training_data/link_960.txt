MDC's School of Education is fortunate to have a state-of-the-art National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)-accredited Pre-School Laboratory Demonstration School at North Campus. Our Pre-School Lab is Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) focused, making this preschool one of only two such preschools in the U.S. (The other was at California Polytechnic University.)
We offer children the chance to explore the wonderful worlds of STEM before they even begin kindergarten.
For more information, visit the Exploration Station.
