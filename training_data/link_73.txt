Florida's higher education system is designed to allow students who wish to earn a bachelor's degree to complete their first two years at a two-year institution such as MDC. This approach to earning a bachelor’s degree is commonly referred to as the 2 + 2 system. The State of Florida has established a statewide articulation agreement that defines this approach and has adopted policies to:
* Admission is not guaranteed to Limited Access programs, which require more competitive criteria. 
** Guaranteed and priority admission based on meeting FAU admissions requirements. Consistent with University policy. Limited access and restricted programs may require additional admissions process.
*A note on limited Access Programs - requirements apply equally to native university students as well as those transferring with a two-year degree. It is important to meet or speak with an Academic & Career Advisor or College Mentor in your selective admission program of choice to ensure you meet all of the requirements. Requirements may change so stay in touch with them regularly. If you do not have an assigned Academic / Departmental Advisor or College Mentor, go to the Academic & Career Services Office at your Campus for assistance.
Students who are planning to transfer without completing the two-year degree A.A. or A.S. degree will be evaluated on their high school transcripts as well as their college coursework. They will also compete for admission with the same criteria as all First Year applicants to the college or university.
State universities in Florida have a uniform foreign language admission requirement that can be met as followed: two years of sequential foreign language in high school, or completion of a postsecondary course at the elementary 2 level in one foreign language in college. Students can satisfy this requirement by CLEP exams or by other means determined by their institution. Please note that American Sign Language will satisfy the foreign language requirement for university admission but may not satisfy graduation requirements for some majors. To be safe, always contact your transfer institution or department for more specific information on the foreign language requirement.
Grade forgiveness policies vary from institution to institution. Additionally, some institutions and selective admission programs may not allow grade forgiveness in the calculation of GPA and as such may recalculate your GPA at the time of application before you are considered for admission or scholarships.
