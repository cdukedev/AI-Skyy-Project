Earn College Credit for Your Prior Learning
The American Council on Education (ACE) has evaluated a pool of courses offered by various online providers that Miami Dade College will accept towards your degree (up to 45 credits). The online classes are designed to help students to finish what they started — a two- or four-year degree, or a post-secondary certificate.
 
 
Digital badges and transcripts should be electronically sent to MDC’s Registrar’s Office at transcriptservices@mdc.edu. You can order your digital badge or transcript using Credly’s Acclaim platform.   
Effective December 1, 2020 transcript services for ACE's Learning Evaluations (formerly CREDIT®) migrated to Credly's Acclaim platform in an effort to provide enhanced credentials to learners and allow additional flexibility for providers.
Many ACE recommended course providers (i.e. Straighterline, Pearson, etc.) are already issuing free digital transcripts and badges, some have elected to no longer participate in ACE transcript services, and others are still transitioning to the new system.
If you completed and passed a course or exam that carries grade recommendations, and your provider has already migrated to the new system, you will be sent an email invitation to claim your free badge. After claiming the badge, you may create an account on Acclaim and use that account to order free ​academic transcripts without further approvals. Visit Acclaim's Transcript help page for questions that may arise regarding ordering or submitting Transcripts.
If you completed an ACE-endorsed course or exam and have not received an email invitation to claim your badge, please contact your training provider (i.e. Pearson, Straighterline, Saylor, etc.) for more information. If you are not sure whom to contact at your training provider, please connect with the ACE Resource Center at credit@acenet.edu for assistance.
You may reach us via phone or email.
