Earn College Credit for Your Prior Learning
 
Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) provides MDC students an opportunity to earn college credit for professional experience. Even if you're not ready to apply yet, MDC is here to help. We have staff on hand who have experience in helping students with prior learning assessment credit.
Earn credits by proving your knowledge through exam programs such as the CLEP, DSST, AP, Excelsior/UExcel, and more.
Boot camp, basic training, officer training school, and other military training and experience are often eligible for credit.
MDC has partnered with educational providers to accept a select number of online courses that have been evaluated by the American Council on Education.
Students who have been admitted to the College may receive credit for courses through departmental examinations.
A portfolio is a great way to demonstrate knowledge earned through work experience or community and volunteer activities.
On-the-job and corporate training can be applied toward a degree through articulation agreements or other evaluations.
