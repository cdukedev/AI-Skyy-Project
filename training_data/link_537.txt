Education is an investment in your future, and we know that the investment can get expensive. But here’s the good news: Every year, the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid office provides more than $83 billion in assistance to millions of students and their families. This aid can be used to pay for tuition and fees, books, supplies and more.
