The center provides reproduction services of documents such as classroom handouts, tests, flyers, memos, etc., and these services are rendered to faculty, administrators, and staff by request.
The Quick Copy Center is bound to comply and enforce copyright guidelines for any material that is considered as "copyrighted" (e.g. books, manuals, etc.).
All requests are done on 8.5" x 11" or 8.5" x 14", normally front-back.
