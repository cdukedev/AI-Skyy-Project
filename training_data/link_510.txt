Term fees and current financial obligations due to the College will be deducted from the financial aid award(s) with the exception of earnings from student employment. Financial aid funds that exceed charges will be refunded to you. If your award is less than your fees, it is your responsibility to pay any remaining balance due before the fee payment deadline to avoid cancellation of your courses.
Each time you add a course, you must go to the Bursar's Office and obtain a receipt for payment. You will be “fee liable” for all courses added to your class schedule after the last day of the Drop/Add period of the semester. Students that enroll in non-credit courses should visit the Bursar's Office to ensure complete validation of their course schedules because non-credit/continuing education courses are not covered by financial aid.
