Miami Dade College's commitment to the enrichment of this community extends beyond the classroom into the local economy. There is no better place to connect with the local economy than at Miami Dade College.  As one of the county's largest and most diverse organizations, Miami Dade College is uniquely positioned to initiate and develop partnerships with businesses as a catalyst for revitalization of our community. A critical component of community revitalization includes economic growth and development of minority, small, and female-owned businesses (MSBEs).  MSBEs provide goods, services, employment and careers for MDC graduates and the community at large.
