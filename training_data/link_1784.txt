The Simulation/Skills Laboratory at Homestead campus  prepares individuals with the evidence-based principles and clinical skills  they will need in real-world clinical environments by helping them reduce  errors, improve safety, and elevate the quality of patient care.
 The Simulation/Skills Laboratory is a supportive learning environment  where evidence-based training is available for various disciplines such as  Nursing, Physician Assistant, EMS, and Respiratory Therapy. Participants are afforded  the opportunity to master skill application and clinical judgement in a non-threatening  environment. Reflection during instructor-facilitated debriefing sessions  fosters the integration of theory and practice, while promoting full spectrum  learning.
 The Simulation/Skills Laboratory includes 2 simulation rooms, 2  debriefing rooms, 2 skills wings, 1 health assessment wing. While at the Simulation/Skills  Laboratory,  participants will develop the necessary critical thinking skills to be  successful in the healthcare field.
 Debriefing is an  indispensable aspect of simulation learning. In the debriefing rooms at the Simulation/Skills  Laboratory participants review and evaluate  their actions while focusing on best practices. During the debriefing sessions,  individuals use observation and real time data video recordings to build on  their knowledge. The video recordings allow individuals and instructors to  evaluate methodologies, stimulate team cooperation and improve patient  outcomes.
