"A legal assistant or paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training or work expereince, who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.  Paralegals may not provide legal services directed to the public except as permitted by law."
- American Bar Association
Career options for trained paralegals are continuing to expand.  Paralegals are trained as legal professionals who can perform substantive legal work under the supervision of attorneys.  While paralegals cannot give legal advice, set fees, negotiate or represent clients in court, they are an integral part of the legal community.
