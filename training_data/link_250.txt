Welcome to the Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences webpage. Our mission is to guide students’ successful transition
                                from MDC to the workforce or to a four-year college or university, having a strong mathematics base
                                with little or no anxiety. Our goal is to eliminate the anxiety out of the equation. Here you will find
                                information about mathematics courses offered including requirements to enroll in subsequent courses.
                                We also offer comprehensive tutorial services via the mathematics lab, run by an outstanding team of
                                instructors. The mathematics faculty and staff strive to ensure that each student attains the necessary
                                skills to further his/her academic and professional development. We invite you to take a moment to explore
                                all the exciting things the Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has to offer.                        
Please refrain from bringing food or drinks into any classroom, lab, or into the courtyard. Please turn
                        off any cellular phones and set pagers to "vibrate." You are expected to arrive on time to class, depart
                        when the class has concluded, and treat others respectfully. You are encouraged to ask questions. The
                        tutors in the lab must help all the students and take turns; they cannot work with one student for a
                        prolonged period of time. We are unable to offer one-to-one continuous tutoring.
