At the Hialeah Campus, our faculty is part of a tight-knit, intimate learning community that understands the unique challenges students face and helps students overcome those challenges. They tackle busy schedules with innovation, bridge language barriers with humor, and inspire students to imagine.
 The result of their efforts is real: From award-winning student publications, to authentic research, to Study Abroad, and much more, the care our faculty puts into their craft creates student success. 
Students are now  welcomed to publish research articles completed under the guidance of a faculty-led research project. Please visit https://issuu.com/mdc-polygon for current and all previous issues of Polygon.  For more information about Polygon, please contact Dr. Shakil at mshakil@mdc.edu.
