Available at Homestead, Kendall, Padrón, North.and Wolfson campuses, The Honors College uses the cohort model of learning so students who begin the program together progress through the core  curriculum together. Our  students empower each other to reach a higher level of personal and academic  growth. Honors-certified faculty teach the core courses designed to help students transfer to some of the most prestigious universities in the nation.
Honors College directors meet with students at least  once per semester to keep them on track. There are six coaching sessions in  total over the course of earning an associate degree. Your plan may change during  the course of discovery. Having  an experienced director guide you  through the process  ensures  you will never lose sight of your ultimate goals.
