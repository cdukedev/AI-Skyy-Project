Interactive My Academic Planner
The interactive My Academic Planner (iMAP) will allow you to design an academic pathway from your 
                first semester in college thru completion of your bachelor’s, tailored by you, for you! This next 
                generation planning tool will help visualize, and compare different scenarios in your academic 
                journey. With this user-friendly tool, you will be able to design a course-by-course seamless 
                pathway for associate degree completion and transfer. 
            
Customize your iMAP pathway, then meet with your advisor! Be advised that the iMAP is not meant to be
                a substitute to meeting regularly with your assigned advisor or following your assigned 
                My Academic Plan (MAP).
            
The iMAP was created by the STEM Seamless Transfer Pathway grant, a Michael & Susan Dell Foundation and Miami Dade College partnership.
For questions, comments or concerns regarding the iMAP, please email the Project Director, Dr. Philip Giarraffa, pgiarraf@mdc.edu.
