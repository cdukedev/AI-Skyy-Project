The general education received  at The Honors College closely mirrors that of many transfer institutions,  meaning students get a quality academic foundation while staying close to home  at very little or no cost. Once qualified applicants are accepted, they receive  the Honors College Fellows Award, which covers all in-state tuition, fees and  books. Our   students then have  the flexibility to use other scholarships for living expenses and supplies,  which minimizes debt and the need for student loans. Other financial support options, including grants, are also  available for qualified students.
                Furthermore,  we help students apply for  scholarships and financial aid to help them with costs after they graduate from  The Honors College. This includes prestigious scholarships such  as the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship, worth up  to $40,000 per year.
