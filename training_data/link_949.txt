Florida Department of Education recognizes MDC SOE’s programs as being among the best teacher preparation programs in state of Florida.

Our Associate in Arts programs prepare you for admission to our bachelor degree program. Most K-12 Teacher Education Program courses require field experience and that the student clear a Level II background check (See Fingerprinting).
