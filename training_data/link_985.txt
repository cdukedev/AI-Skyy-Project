Thank you for your  interest in MDC Medical Campus. Medical Campus programs are limited access and  students must complete milestones in order to determine eligibility to move  forward in their discipline classes.  In  order to have your records reviewed during the selection process, you must  request a Milestone Review prior to the program’s Target Review Dates.  Milestone Review Dates can be found on the program’s websites.  Advisors are available to assist students in  understanding program requirements and milestones.  Please visit Advisement and Career  Services for assistance.
