Miami Dade College has a process in place for allowing students to take a placement test on a remote testing basis and also supervises examinations for other institutions, employers, agencies, and certification boards to take an exam at MDC or via a technology supported online proctoring service. The Testing and Assessment Departments use the term "Remote Testing" to describe this process.
For information regarding fees, please visit the Tests webpage for test specific fees or the Testing Fees webpage for general information.
Additionally, current MDC students, faculty, and staff may borrow mobile devices and equipment, such as laptops, tablets, and more. 
If you have a midterm or final exam in one or more of your classes, you may need to use a technology-supported tool and/or proctor. Visit the Technology Supported Tools and Proctors webpage for additional information.
