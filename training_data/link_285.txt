You are an important part of the Shark Family!
At MDC we want to support you as your new student makes the transition to college. Here are resources we think will help you. 
This is the cost per unit/credit hour to attend MDC. Your student’s tuition rate will depend on their 
                                        status as a resident or non-resident of Florida.
                                        Learn more about tuition.

 If your student is under the age of 24, and you are a FL resident, 
                                        they will need copies of documents proving that you are a FL resident for 
                                        tuition purposes. Learn more about what documents we need from you. Also, 
                                        if your student is applying for financial aid, they will need copies of your 
                                        prior year taxes and W2s. You will also need to get an FSA ID. Learn more about applying for 
                                            financial aid.
 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) 
                                        is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. FERPA gives parents 
                                        certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer 
                                        to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high 
                                        school level. Learn more about FERPA and you and your student’s rights. 
MDC offers convenient, flexible, and affordable programs. Whether you are looking to change careers or advance in your current profession, MDC has a program for you.  
If you think you should qualify for Florida resident in-state fees, please complete the online FL Residency Declaration Form and upload copies of documentation proving your FL residency directly to the Admissions office. 

Make sure you have completed a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to apply for federal financial aid. Apply even if you think you may not be eligible. Many scholarship programs require that students complete a FAFSA in order to be considered.
