She has been working in the field of jazz, improvised and experimental music, since moving to New York in 2008. Literature, film, visual arts, nature and history inspire her creative process and development of her music. She is described by the New York Times as “a singer of silvery poise and cosmopolitan outlook” and by JazzTimes magazine as “a master of wordless landscapes."
