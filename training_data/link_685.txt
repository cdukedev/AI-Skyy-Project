To help prevent crimes and to keep the College community informed about safety and security issues on an ongoing basis, the Campus Public Safety Departments issue Timely Warnings for Clery Act crimes that are considered to represent a serious or continuing threat to students and employees. Members of the College community who know of a crime or other serious incident should immediately report that incident to the appropriate Campus Public Safety Department so that the incident can be evaluated, and a Timely Warning can be issued, if warranted.
