The Student Government Association (SGA) is the voice of the student body. It's role is to address the concerns and issues of students attending MDC Medical Campus.
Members represent the student body at campus and college-wide meetings. They also develop teamwork, leadership and organizational skills that are vital in today's competitive job market.
SGA members also work together to plan activities for the entire student body. These activities include stress relievers, heritage celebrations, awareness programs, and fund raisers for the Campus Food Bank and for community agencies such as the United Way.
SGA Members have the opportunity to represent the Medical Campus student body on committees, such as Grade Appeals, Graduation, and Legislative Action.
As an active SGA member you have an opportunity to travel to conferences, retreats and meetings with representatives from other schools and have an opportunity to meet and discuss student concerns.
