NEW Computer Competency Requirement Exemption!
Students who passed an MDC recognized certification that is aligned with one or more of the seven competency areas on the Computer Placement Test (CSP) are eligible for an exemption if five (5) or more of the areas are met with the certifications. See Questions & Answers below for the testing criteria and guidelines for Computer Competency.
To request this exemption, students must provide their certification(s).
Transfer students who satisfied a college's computer competency requirement by an examination, may receive an exemption from the Computer Competency requirement at MDC, if the examination was used to satisfy a course requirement equivalent to CGS1060 or CTS0050.
To apply, transfer students must provide an official test score report and supporting course documents such as course description in college catalog from the transferring institution.
Send required documentation to the College's Institutional Test Administrator via silvio.rodriguez@mdc.edu for verification and approval.
