The MDC School of Aviation has a partnership agreement with the  local flight school Wayman Aviation and ADF Airways. In accordance with FAA regulations, the  school operates under Part 141 certification and approval.
        Since the School of Aviation does not have its own aircraft fleet,  our community partnerships provide the practical application of knowledge  gained in the classroom. A minimum of 35 hours is required to obtain a private  pilot's license, but most aspiring pilots can accrue as much as 60 plus hours  of flight time before they pass their FAA checkride, or final exam.
        At MDC's School of Aviation, students are able to use our more  cost effective simulators to supplement their logged flight time, and in the  process, obtain a professional aviation degree.
Our associate degrees  and certificate programs are designed to meet the needs of students interested  in becoming tomorrow’s professionals. Our FAA-approved courses blend theory  with application to provide students with the theoretical knowledge and  real-world skills needed to succeed in the 21st century.
