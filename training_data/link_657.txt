The Student Food Pantry provides a means for students to stay focused on their academic studies despite any untimely financial hardships they may be faced with while pursuing a degree.
To receive food from the pantry, students must present their Miami Dade College student ID card and be enrolled at MDC in the current semester.
Students will be provided with various non-perishable items from the pantry. Students are encouraged to bring their own grocery bag. Supplies are limited and will be distributed on a first-come first-serve basis.
Want to help us keep the Pantry stocked for students in need? Donations are accepted during open office hours. We accept non-perishable (non-expired) food, gift cards to local grocery stores, monetary donations, hygiene products, and baby supplies.
For information about campus locations and hours of operations visit MDC Food Pantries.
For more information, please contact the Single Stop coordinator at your campus of preference.
