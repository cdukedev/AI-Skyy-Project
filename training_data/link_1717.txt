	Dear MDC Family,

	During the month of February, we come together to honor and celebrate Black History Month. What makes Miami Dade College so unique are the vibrant cultures that make up our community, and we take pride in serving as the cultural catalyst that honors the heritage of our students, faculty and staff.

	Our community has a lot to be proud of as we celebrate this month, with a rich history of influential leaders who have made significant contributions both at MDC and beyond. Letâs commemorate visionary leaders like Congresswoman Carrie P. Meek, the first African American woman administrator at the College, and countless others who have committed their lives to paving a pathway for our students to ensure their dreams turn into realities. I extend a warm invitation to all members of our community to 
participate in a series of inspiring events across our eight campuses recognizing the achievements of those who came before us and the pioneers who continue to break barriers today.

	Embracing the spirit of our trailblazers, Letâs envision a future where, collectively, we continue to make a positive impact.

	With gratitude,



	Madeline Pumariega
	President
	Miami Dade College
