Licensure is not required to practice as a Veterinary Technician in the State of Florida but all graduates are encouraged to take the Veterinary Technician National Exam (VTNE) with the American Association of Veterinary State Boards (AAVSB). Only graduates of an AVMA-Accredited Veterinary Technology program are eligible to take the VTNE. Upon successful completion of this exam, the graduate will be eligible to apply for certification, which is valid for two years. This certification will be maintained by completing the required continuing education credits (15 credits every two years).
