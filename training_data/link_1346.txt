The seed for InterAmerican Campus (now Padrón Campus) was planted in 1972 when the College offered two night-courses at the Belen Jesuit  Prep School. Sixty students enrolled. By 1979, the program had blossomed into  the Wolfson Campus' Division of Bilingual Studies, enrolling 2,000 students.
In the early 1980s, an influx of students from Latin America and the Caribbean led to the addition of
            day classes and full-time faculty. By 1986, the division had grown to "center" designation, and it moved
            into a building in Little Havana purchased by the College Foundation.
InterAmerican  Center became the largest bilingual learning environment in all of higher education. When
            enrollment reached 5,500, the College District Board of Trustees petitioned the state of Florida for "campus"
            status. The request was approved and on March 27, 2001, InterAmerican Campus was born, becoming the
            sixth campus of Miami Dade College.
Today,  Padrón Campus offers students over 200 degree and  certificate programs, including an A.S. in Translation  and Interpretation studies, certificate programs in Early  Childhood Education, and a B.A.S. in Supervision and Management.  It is also home to the dual-language  Honors College, and the School of Education, which offers  bachelor's degree programs in Early  Childhood Education,Secondary Mathematics Education, Exceptional  Student Education.
