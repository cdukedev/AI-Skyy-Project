Guidelines for Borrowing and Use
Only current MDC students, faculty, or staff may borrow mobile devices & equipment. 
       Personal accounts may NOT be linked to any Learning Resources device under any condition. 
       A return receipt will be provided at the time of return after staff inspection of equipment finds all items are in good condition and standards set by this User Agreement have been adhered to. 
       Guidelines, agreements, and permissions are at the Directorâ€™s discretion. 
        
       You will need to visit your campus library to check availability of a device.
