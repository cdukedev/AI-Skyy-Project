Florida Residency for Tuition Purpose Classification 

All students will be admitted as non-Florida residents until each student provides the required declaration form and supporting documentation needed to prove Florida residency. You will be charged out-of-state tuition if you do not provide the Florida Residency Declaration Form and supporting documentation.
The Florida Residency Declaration Form must be received no later than the 100% refund date for the session/term in which Florida residency is being requested. Otherwise, the Florida classification for tuition purposes will be effective the following term.
You can now complete and submit your Florida residency declaration for tuition purposes online.
