	Dear ,

		The holiday season is a time to reflect on the blessings of the past year and celebrate the collective spirit of our remarkable community at Miami Dade College. Together with our dedicated world-class faculty, staff and students, we have created an environment where dreams are realized, futures are shaped, and possibilities are limitless. The trust each of you has placed in our mission, transforms the lives of the students we serve and propels MDC toward bolder futures.

		As we close out an academic semester and usher in a new year at MDC, I am confident that, together, we will continue to build on our successes and forge new pathways to opportunities in our community. May your holiday season be filled with joyous moments spent alongside your loved ones, and may the approaching New Year usher in a renewed sense of purpose, achievement, health, and happiness.

	With gratitude,



	Madeline
