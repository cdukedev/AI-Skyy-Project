Dear students,
Welcome to the North Campus of Miami Dade College!
On behalf of the academic community at the  North Campus, congratulations on your choice to join the MDC family - where  students always come first and where your education is our top priority!
We are driven by the college mission "to  provide accessible, affordable, high-quality education by keeping the learner's  needs at the center of the decision-making and working in partnership with its  dynamic multicultural community."
For more than six decades our institution  has proudly served the diverse South Florida community and has provided an  exceptionally supportive and inclusive learner-centered environment for your educational  success and personal growth. At the North Campus, we embrace our responsibility  to prepare students not only for a successful career in the 21st century job  market but also as mindful citizens in a global society and an economy defined  by change and challenge.         I urge you to explore our unique programs at the North Campus and at Carrie P. Meek Entrepreneurial Education Center, to find your calling and own pathway to  success, to complete a college credential, and to always keep learning.
I am honored to lead the academic affairs  team and to be associated with our talented team of faculty at the North Campus  of MDC. With a strong focus on students' individual growth, our faculty are  committed to teaching excellence and quality learning experiences in all  academic areas, majors, and courses. Our faculty value tradition and seek  innovations to benefit and improve student learning. They will engage you in  learning activities in and beyond the classroom; they will challenge, encourage,  and guide you in your educational journey; they will create life-long memories  and a sense of belonging to our campus community and college.        Our team is here to serve you and our  doors are always open.
