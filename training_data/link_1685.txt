Data Liaisons are Miami Dade College employees who partner with and are trained by the Division of Strategy and Institutional Effectiveness (SIE) on behalf of their campus, academic school/program, or district unit to increase the College's capacity for data informed decision making, research, data analysis, assessment, and evaluation.
Although their specific roles and responsibilities vary, Data Liaisons serve as consultants and resources to their leadership, respective units and campus on matters related to research, data analysis, assessment, and evaluation for internal purposes only. Data Liaisons are appointed by the leadership of the campus, academic school/program, or district unit; except for the Testing and Assessment Directors whose essential duties and responsibilities includes serving as a campus Data Liaison for the Division of Strategy and Institutional Effectiveness.
Data Liaisons may be provided access to data files containing individual student-level information. In addition, they must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations and with all institutional policies, procedures, and accepted practice for ensuring the security of student and personnel records; protecting student and personnel privacy; and using data ethically and responsibly.
