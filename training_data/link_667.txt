Miami Dade College has seven campuses and two centers throughout Dade County. Each campus has its own Public Safety Chief and its own command staff (Assistant Chiefs/Sergeants/Corporals and Officers).
Be assured that campus safety is the ultimate goal of all the department’s efforts. We aspire to provide the resources to prevent crime, protect and serve the college community and to provide services to the college that promotes the ultimate goal of campus safety.
