A participating employer is a business entity who hires, employs, and pays the wages of apprentices. Employers match apprentices with journeyworkers who serve as guides to the apprentices. Apprentices are evaluated by mentors and assessed for apprenticeship advancement. To participate, an employer must enter into a written agreement with the Miami Dade College GNJ – Apprenticeship Program. Employer Agreements outline the minimum requirements established for each occupation, including learning outcomes, mentorship, progressive wages, and ratio of apprentice to journeyworker.
