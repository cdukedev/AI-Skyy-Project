Get off to a great start with classes that are best for you!
Be prepared for success! MDC encourages you to take advantage of our college placement test to make sure you enroll in classes that best fit your skills.
According to Florida Statutes [Rule 6A-10.0315, College Preparatory Testing, Placement, and Instruction], some degree-seeking students are required to be tested before enrolling for classes. Others are exempt from testing and placement in developmental education courses. Regardless, taking the placement test is a good idea!
MDC provides you with a wide range of campus assistance to help you succeed in college.
Please contact your academic advisor to assess your readiness for college-level course work and to select your classes. For additional information regarding testing exemptions for Developmental Education, please review the Placement Criteria.  
However, all students are strongly encouraged to take the placement test.
