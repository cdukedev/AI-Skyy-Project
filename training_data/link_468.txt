Students are given an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback to faculty in regular credit and career credit courses. Student feedback for faculty is assessed using a standardized questionnaire provided by MDC, and feedback reports are available to students, faculty, and administrators.

        All faculty members participate in the student feedback during each Fall Term and the results are made available in January. Additional survey results are accumulated for participating faculty during the Spring Term (available in May) and Summer Term (available in September).        
Students evaluate faculty in traditional classroom courses including Web-enhanced, Blended and Labs (Classroom Survey is administered); courses in special programs such as Co-Op, Independent Studies, Competency-based Education, Study Abroad, MDC Live, and MDC Online (Alternate Survey is administered);  and in the Library Services area (Faculty Librarian Survey is administered). 
Lab  and clinical classes that students directly enroll in through their registration  in the lab or clinical course are required for Student Feedback. Lab  and clinical classes that students are automatically enrolled in through their  registration in the lecture course are not required for Student Feedback.  Faculty who are actually instructing students in these labs may administer  student feedback for these classes on a request basis through their department  chairperson.
