The theater department develops talented students into technically skilled and creatively inspired professionals. Employing a rigorous course of study and close, personal attention, the skilled members of the theater department faculty provide instruction in acting, movement, and voice.
Students study major works – from classical repertory through the 20th century – and bring the skills and techniques they’ve learned to center stage through a full schedule of workshops and productions.
Housed in Building M, the department has access to a specially designed, 150-seat black box theater and additional facilities that include dressing rooms, classroom and rehearsal space, scene and costume shops, and a lobby.
You can play a part in  transforming the lives of our talented theater students through scholarships  and academic program initiatives. Your contribution ensures that PAI continues  to be a vital source in enriching the lives of students and the community through  the performing arts.
The curriculum includes courses in theater performance, technical theater and theater appreciation.
