Successful completion of the MDC level two background check process or completion of a MDC nursing/health sciences program does not guarantee a graduate’s eligibility for participation in the professional credentialing process or for related employment. Credentialing agencies and health care employers may have additional eligibility criteria not required by an educational institution. Individuals who have been arrested or convicted for any crime are strongly urged to inquire directly of the licensing board in the jurisdiction in which they intend to practice.
Upon completion of the Massage Therapy program, graduates are eligible to apply for one of the National Certification Board examinations. Once the National Board Exam is successfully completed, the graduate can apply to the Florida Board of Massage Therapy for issuance of State of Florida Massage Therapy License.
