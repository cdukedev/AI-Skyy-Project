 
Greetings and welcome to Student Life!
Welcome MDC – North Campus Sharks! If you are new to our North  Campus family, please stop by and say hello. The Student Life Department will  be your second home while you pursue your degree at MDC – North Campus. We are  here to enhance your education with creating lifelong learning co-curricular  activities and initiatives, service learning opportunities, clubs and events  throughout the year.
		  As an MDC Shark, we encourage you to join a student organization.  If you cannot find a student organization that interests you, please feel free  to meet with our Student Life Specialist to start your own. Student Life is  here to spark your passion and enhance your co-curricular experience!  
		  Please feel free to stop by the Student Government Association  office in room 4212 to learn how you can be apart of effecting change and  advocating for causes on your campus and in your community. 
		  As an alumni of MDC- North Campus, I am sure you will enjoy your  time with us during your academic journey. If you are in the area and have any  suggestions or you would like to discuss an idea you may have regarding student  activities, please feel free to stop by. The doors of Student Life are always  open! 
Enjoy your semester and we will see you at the finish line!
