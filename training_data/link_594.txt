Student Government Association (SGA) is an organization that represents all students rather than one special interest group on campus.
				  SGA works as a liaison between the student population and the administration. We serve, represent and advocate for the students. All concerns, suggestions, comments, and solutions are addressed by SGA in a professional and powerful way, so that the faculty and administration are kept up to date as to what affects students. We also interact with the students and get involved in numerous activities.  SGA is a gateway to so many wonderful things. You can gain valuable skills in civic responsibility, financial management, embracing diversity, serving the community, interpersonal and cross-cultural communication. 

Join SGA and be part of the Excitement!
