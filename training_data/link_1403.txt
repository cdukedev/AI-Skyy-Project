Miguel B. Fernandez Family School of Global Business, Trade and Transportation
College credit certificates and associate degrees may be earned on their own, or they can be stacked to form a path leading to a four-year degree. The benefit of stacking is that as you progress along your path, you earn additional credentials while saving time by only taking courses that lead directly to your intended degree.                
An Associate in Science degree is ideal for those who intend to enter the workforce after two years. Graduates who earn this degree are prepared for employment and their course credits are easily transferable to  a Bachelor of Applied Science in their field of  interest.
