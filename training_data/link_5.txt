Pre-apprenticeship programs prepare individuals to enter an apprenticeship through short-term learning and ultimately succeed in a career. Pre-apprenticeship programs are connected to existing apprenticeship programs and provide individuals with classroom instruction, on the job learning and mentorships while being compensated. Through pre-apprenticeships, individuals gain the knowledge and skills that are needed towards building a career pathway.
Registered Apprenticeship is an industry-driven, high-quality career pathway where employers can develop and prepare their future workforce, and individuals can obtain paid work experience, receive progressive wage increases, classroom instruction, and a portable, nationally-recognized credential.  Registered Apprenticeships are industry-vetted and approved and validated by the U.S. Department of Labor and Florida Department of Education.
