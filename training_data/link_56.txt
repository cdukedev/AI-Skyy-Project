Earn College Credit for Your Prior Learning
 
Miami Dade College offers a limited number of Portfolio Options. A prior learning portfolio describes and documents relevant knowledge gained from experiential learning and equates that knowledge to academic courses. The portfolio consists of a learning narrative and supporting documentation of verified learning. Portfolios are assessed by qualified faculty to determine mastery of the equivalent college course. The Office of Prior Learning can assist you in learning more about the available portfolio options at MDC.
The 25% residency requirement of the College cannot be satisfied through portfolio.
You must contact the Office of Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) to get started and obtain approval for the MDC courses you would like to submit through the portfolio. No language courses, capstones, internships, practicums, field work, applied courses, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), courses with labs, or lab courses are permitted.
The student must submit a Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) Questionnaire outlining your previous work experience. You may fill out your Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) Questionnaire here.
Upon receipt, the PLA Coordinator will review the student's questionnaire and schedule an appointment with the student to discuss the request for portfolio-based assessment.
