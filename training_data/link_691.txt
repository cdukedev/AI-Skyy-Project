By registering your cell phone number with the college, you will receive emergency text messages alerting you of a current or imminent threat. Your cell phone must have text messaging capabilities. Miami Dade College will use this information for emergency communication purposes only.
Depending on the nature and severity of the emergency, local news stations may carry live breaking news or periodic updates regarding an emergency on campus. Their websites may also carry live streaming video, video clips, or text updates.
MDC can quickly alert students, faculty, and staff of emergency conditions by sending an e-mail to your official @mdc.edu or @mymdc.net e-mail address.
Official emergency information may also be accessed by calling the Student Hotline, 305-237-7500, or Employee Hotline, 305-237-7505. Please keep in mind that this recording may take several minutes to update.
