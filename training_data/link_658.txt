Are you a parent?
MDC can support you in every step along your academic journey! MDC offers assistance to anyone who cares for a child under 18 no matter their age, background, or family structure. We offer free assistance for scholarship opportunities, academic support, childcare options, professional development, basic needs, and more!
At MDC, parents and their families are engaged in a village of support that provides access to free services and delivers wrap-around support to eliminate barriers and ensure success. You don’t have to do it alone, we’re here to help! Not a student? Register today and follow us on Instagram for more information on free resources @MDCStudentParents!
The Mission North Star program is funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation.
