The first point of contact for prospective and new students, who are attending college for the first-time or who are transferring from another institution, is the New Student Center. Prospective students are encouraged to meet with a pre-admission advisor, ensuring that their first contact with the Campus is a customer friendly experience and facilitates their transition to the College.
The New Student Center conducts orientation sessions prior to each semester. All new degree-seeking students are required to participate in an orientation program. The objective of the new student orientation sessions is to provide practical information to assist new students in transitioning to college life.
This provides incoming students with enough information to assist them in navigating through the system and becoming acquainted with the college’s services, programs, personnel and fellow students. Topics covered include:
