MDC Online has provided award-winning online credit courses to students since 1997. The online courses and programs offered by MDC Online are an excellent alternative to classroom-based instruction for the students of Miami Dade College. We take pride in a diverse community of engaged, mature students.
At MDC Online, a staff of technical and functional professionals supports the development of new online courses, the teaching of existing online courses, the students in online courses, and the technology used in these courses.
MDC Online courses require proctored midterm and/or final exams during specified testing dates. The course material will indicate the window of time students have to take the required proctored exams in each course.
MDC Online has a limited virtual testing center. Appointments are scheduled on a limited basis through the Remote Testing Request Form.
