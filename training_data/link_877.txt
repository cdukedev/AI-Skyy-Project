The Aircraft Dispatcher Certification course prepares students to take the FAA Aircraft Dispatcher examinations. In cooperation with the pilot, the flight dispatcher furnishes a flight plan that enables the aircraft to arrive at its destination on schedule with the maximum payload and the least operating cost. The flight dispatcher considers en route and destination weather, winds aloft, alternate destinations, fuel required, altitudes, and traffic flow. The dispatcher’s signature, along with that of the pilot, releases the aircraft for flight.
Upon successful completion of this course students will receive an endorsement allowing them to take the knowledge and practical skills examinations. Books and examinations not included.
Entry level light dispatchers earn between $42,000 - $60,000 with $110,000+ top end annual salary...
