ACCESS: A Comprehensive Center for Exceptional Student Services

ACCESS empowers students to succeed by enabling students with disabilities to maximize their talents, skills, and abilities. Its goal is equal access and opportunity.
In addition to its role in the classroom, the department works to promote awareness of disability issues, federal and state regulations, and College procedures that encourage accessibility and inclusion.
ACCESS’s commitment to disability services extends beyond the college experience. The department is also a voter registration site. Through the MEED program, students are able to access services that help them attain employment.
The Model for Enhanced Employment Development (MEED) program is supported by The Able Trust, which provides opportunities for successful employment for individuals with disabilities across Florida.
