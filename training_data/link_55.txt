We would like to welcome you to Miami Dade College and the MDC Veteran & Military Services family. We realize your decision to enroll in college was thoughtful and yet a bit intimidating. Please know you have an entire department at your service to help you transition to college life. Here's how:
Our Veteran & Military Services Resource Guide is a valuable tool for you to use for step-by-step instructions, viewing required documents for various GI Bills, educational information for navigating MDC college life, tuition assistance and scholarships, out-of-state tuition waivers, and examples of various forms.
Please reach out to us with any questions or concerns. Our main office number is 305-237-2841. You may also schedule a virtual appointment with one of the staff.
It is our honor to serve those that have served.
Veterans can obtain a basic skills assessment, preparation postsecondary test, assistance with GI benefits and forms, and linkage to various support groups and services around the community.
