Miami Dade College (MDC) wishes to honor veteran students who have served our country. Based on a change in Florida Statute (F.S.) 1009.25(2) regarding fee exemptions, MDC is now offering an out-of-state tuition waiver for eligible veteran students, their spouses and dependent children.
Veteran students, their spouses and dependent children must meet the following criteria to be eligible to apply for the out-of-state tuition waiver:
Once the waiver is approved and applied to your account, the out-of-state tuition waiver will allow you to pay the in-state tuition portion; however, you will remain classified as out-of-state for tuition purposes. The out-of-state tuition waiver may be combined with VA benefits, financial aid and other scholarships, for which you should verify your eligibility with the Financial Aid Office and your home campus.
The veteran student out-of-state tuition waiver will be offered on a renewable basis--as long as the minimum academic requirements are met as stipulated above--until the veteran student, spouse, and/or dependent children become Florida resident(s) for tuition purposes, as established by Florida state laws, 1009.21, Florida Statutes (F.S.) and 6A-10.044, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), but not to exceed one year from the first day of the term for which the waiver is granted.
No retroactive reimbursement of tuition payments for previous terms will be made.
Please contact your Home Campus Veteran & Military Clerk/Liaison for assistance with your out-of-state tuition waiver application.
