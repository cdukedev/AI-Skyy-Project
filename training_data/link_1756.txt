Dion Tucker is an accomplished trombonist, composer and music educator with an oeuvre that defies genre. Boston-born and Miami-bred, Tucker moved to New York in 1998 to study at The New School under the tutelage of pioneering trombonists Benny Powell and Steve Turre, among others. 
In 2001, he had the privilege of touring with the rock band Matchbox 20 and was lead trombonist in The Duke Ellington Orchestra from 2003 until 2013. Since 2007, Dion has been a member of The Harry Connick Jr. Big Band and had the unique opportunity to perform with Connick for President Barack Obama at the 2012 Governors Ball, at the Papal Mass for Pope Benedict at Yankee Stadium, as lead trombonist in the Broadway revival of On A Clear Day, and as trombonist in the stage adaptation of the Academy Award-winning film, The Sting.  
As an educator, Tucker has taught in over 20 New York City public schools through the Jazz at Lincoln Center’s “Jazz for Young People” program. He is currently the director of Jazz at the New Jersey Youth Symphony and is an adjunct professor at New York University. Tucker has created his own online teaching platform, “The Chops Shop.” 
Tucker has made countless television appearances and has performed at the North Carolina Jazz Festival, with the Lincoln Center All-Star Band, on the Grammy Award-winning gospel album Let Them Fall in Love by CeCe Winans, and on many other collaborations.
