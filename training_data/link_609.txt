                     Founded in 2004 by Professor Elena Perez and Professor Lisa Shaw, the AXIS Creative Arts Magazine publishes an annual issue showcasing the creative work of students at the North Campus. AXIS is a product of cross-disciplinary collaboration. Housed in the English and Communications Department, AXIS also features the work of students in the Arts & Philosophy, and School of Entertainment and Design Technology (SEDT) departments of North Campus.  Since Volume 10, the AXIS editing team has worked under the guidance of Professor Carmen Bucher and Professor Kate Noonan.   Starting with Volume 11, AXIS has collaborated with the design students of SEDT at North Campus under the guidance of Professor Eric Cornish.  The AXIS editing and design team have complete creative and editorial control of this state and national award-winning student publication.
Our mission is to provide an opportunity for students to publicize their creative works of poetry, prose, essays, art (traditional and digital), photography, and music.
We accept submissions year-round from all North Campus students in any field of study, major, or pathway. We also accept work produced in other languages and accept submissions in varying art forms including digital illustration, photography, paintings, mixed-media, screen plays, music videos, etc. Students can submit their creative work for selection via email at axis.creativearts@gmail.com.
How does selection for the publication work? After you submit your work, the pieces will be judged by the Axis Creative Arts Magazine editorial board. The selection process is open to all North Campus students. The pieces you submit will be reviewed anonymously and scored. Once scoring is complete, someone on the editorial board will email you informing you of your status. If your piece is selected, the editors may ask to make changes to the piece or as your permission to make changes. Before publication, the editing team reserves the right to make grammatical corrections especially in prose pieces.  	 The Axis Creative Arts Magazine meets every week on campus to develop, plan, and edit the magazine. Please email the staff at axis.creativearts@gmail.com for dates and times.                  
The AXIS editorial team removes contributors' names to score submissions and select pieces. Notifications are sent to let students know if their work was selected or not. If your work is selected, the editorial team will contact you; your piece may be accepted as is, or you may be asked to make changes (for written works). Before publication, the editing team reserves the right to make grammatical corrections, especially in prose pieces.
