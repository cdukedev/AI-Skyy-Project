
                    We have multiple courses and programs that are aligned with industry certifications. In most of them we provide you with preparation materials, vouchers to take the certification exam for free, or reimbursement if you already paid and passed the certification while studying at MDC.
                Industry Certifications are a powerful way to show current and future employers that you’re qualified for a job, prepared for a promotion, and that you’re willing to go the extra mile to continuously improve your skills. 

        Students who are enrolled in a college-level or vocational credit course and pass the certification exam, will be reimbursed for the cost of the exam.
