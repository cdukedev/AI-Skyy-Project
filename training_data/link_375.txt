Admissions and support information for international students
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) defines employment as:
(*) The F-1 regulations are very clear on who qualifies for off-campus employment authorization and who does not. Students in exchange programs and students in English for Academic Purposes (EAP), do not qualify for any type of off-campus paid employment before or after since they do not meet the eligibility requirements for these Immigration benefits.
IMPORTANT! We strongly suggest you request Optional Practical Training (OPT) prior to the completion of all course requirements for the degree or prior to the completion of the course of study.
                   The deadline to submit your post completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) application is no less than 15 business days prior to the end of the 60-day grace period after completion of your studies.
