                 Our vision is to provide an outstanding curriculum and strategically formulated programs that exceed the critical demands of the high-technology marketplace, resulting in our students having a wide variety of options for success in the 21st century.

               Our goal is to teach our students to harness the power that engineering and technology fields provide through hands-on training from our world-class faculty.
Our students are passionate, bright and technologically savvy with a keen sense of creativity. Through our programs and curricula, they learn to adapt their skills to design and apply creative solutions to real-world needs. 
While attending EnTec, our students regularly compete against each other and other students in South Florida to showcase their skills and expertise. They are also afforded opportunities to visit our industry leaders to see how their education directly applies to industry, allowing them networking opportunities with our industry partners for possible future employment.
As our students graduate and move into the field, they find in-demand careers with companies and organizations such as Florida Power & Light, Tesla, Amazon Web Services, Mastercard, Miami Heats and more.
