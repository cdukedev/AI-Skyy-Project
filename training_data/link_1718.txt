	Dear MDC Family,

	As we commemorate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it is a poignant moment for us to reflect on the impact he has made in the hearts and minds of people around the world. Dr. Kingâs words have echoed throughout history, paving the pathways of opportunities that have proved that the American Dream is attainable for everyone who dreams of a better future.

	As a passionate leader who believed in the transformative power of education, he once said, âEducation must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern true from false, to think not only about the past and present but also about the future.â These words resonate deeply with our mission here at Miami Dade College where we are dedicated to promoting an educational environment that inspires our students to think critically and are encouraged to explore and engage with the world around them. Together, we are shaping the future by preparing our students not only for the challenges of today but also for the opportunities and responsibilities that lie ahead.

	This year, we will again honor Dr. Kingâs memory by hosting a variety of programming across all of our campuses. Be sure to visit the MDC events calendar
 page to find out how you can participate. The Institute for Civic Engagement and Democracy (iCED) and Student Life have also partnered with City Year Miami, Urban Paradise Guild, Historic Virginia Key Beach Park, Citizens for a Better South Florida, Clean Miami Beach, and other organizations to provide a host of service opportunities beginning Friday and through the holiday weekend. Examples include coastal cleanups, elementary school beautification, organic garden preparation, park cleanups, and activities with senior citizens. For details and to RSVP, simply email 
mlk@mdc.edu or contact your campusâ iCED office.

	May we reflect on the life of Dr. King as we give back to others in our community, recognizing that each of us can contribute to making a difference.

	With gratitude,



	Madeline Pumariega
	President
	Miami Dade College
