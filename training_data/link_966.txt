The Educator Preparation Institute (EPI) is an intensive competency-based alternative pathway to teacher certification. Through an accelerated program, individuals who have earned at least a bachelor’s degree in a non-Education major can satisfy the requirements to receive a professional teaching certificate from the state of Florida.
While students enrolled in the EPI program can obtain certification in any of the areas offered by the Florida Department of Education, areas of high-need include: Exceptional Student Education (K-12), Mathematics Education (6-12), Science Education (6-12), and English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) (K-12). MDC SOE’S EPI has been ranked No. 1 in the State of Florida in terms of positive impact on P-12 student learning!
The EPI is a seven-course program (21 credits) that can be completed in one year. The program adheres to rigorous standards and includes clinical experience. Please note: the EPI program must be completed in its entirety for certification. Classes are held on Fridays and Saturdays.
EPI courses earn “institutional credit.” This credit is recognized by the FLDOE only for the purpose of determining that all EPI coursework requirements have been met for teacher certification in Florida. While EPI course credit may be transferable to other EPI programs in Florida, it cannot be transferred to a degree program. However, occasionally, courses substitutions can be made for education courses for which traditional credit was earned. A SOE advisor can provide details regarding transfer of credits and course substitutions.
