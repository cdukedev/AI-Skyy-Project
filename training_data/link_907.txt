Student Food Pantry
The Student Food Pantry provides a means for students to stay focused on their academic studies despite any untimely financial hardships they may be faced with while pursuing a degree.
Student Eligibility
To receive food from the pantry, students must present their Miami Dade College student ID card and be enrolled at MDC in the current semester. 
Visiting the Pantry
Students will be provided with various non-perishable items from the pantry.  Students are encouraged to bring their own grocery bag. Supplies are limited and will be distributed on a first-come first-serve basis. 
Donating to the Pantry
Want to help us keep the Pantry stocked for students in need? Donations are accepted during open office hours. We accept non-perishable (non-expired) food, gift cards to local grocery stores,  monetary donations, hygiene products, and baby supplies.
