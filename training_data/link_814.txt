Greetings!
On behalf of the entire Miami Dade College community, welcome. I am honored to be the president of MDC's vibrant Homestead Campus.  We are located in the historic business district of downtown Homestead. Often referred to as ‘the gateway to the Florida Keys,’ Homestead is a rapidly growing community that is expected to double in population within the next five years. Over the past decade, the campus has experienced remarkable growth, earning a reputation for excellence and innovation. Still, the core of our mission has remained the same - providing quality, affordable, and accessible education to the families and important communities we serve.

						  Successful student learning is our top priority. I invite you to explore our Web site to learn more about our award-winning facilities and programs, including our world-class aviation, nursing, business, education, and science programs, among others. While our programs, facilities, and learning technologies are of exceptional quality, what truly sets MDC Homestead apart is its people.  Like the programs, our students here are as diverse as the range of courses. I am particularly proud of the compassion and spirit of collaboration that is shared by everyone associated with this institution.

						  Our highly-qualified faculty and staff are committed to excellence and to providing quality education and services to our growing community. With the assistance of our dedicated staff, students are provided support with financial aid, registration, advisement, career services, and technology.

						  Of course, the best way to experience Miami Dade College is to pay us a visit. When you come to the Homestead campus, you will discover an extraordinarily welcoming community of students, faculty, and staff; a campus that celebrates diversity in all of its forms; a place that feels like home from the moment you arrive. A place where H.O.M.E. stands for Hope, Opportunity, Motivation, and Excellence.

						 I look forward to seeing you on campus in the near future!

Oscar Loynaz, MD
