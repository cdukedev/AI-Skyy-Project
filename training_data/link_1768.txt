Dr. Mariana V. Molina (Psychology) developed and leads the Annual Student Interdisciplinary Symposium, a signature co-curricular event at the Hialeah Campus open to all Miami Dade College students, faculty, and staff. This event takes place in the Spring semester each academic year. The goal of the Symposium is to provide an opportunity for students to share their explorations, discoveries, and reflections with their peers, and the broader academic community. The aim is to promote scholarship, undergraduate research, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The symposium typically features poster sessions, oral presentations, panel discussions, and information tables. Students' creative academic work, including authentic research and service-learning projects, conducted under the guidance of Miami Dade College faculty, are highlighted and recognized at this annual event. To find more information on how to participate, please contact Dr. Molina at mmolina5@mdc.edu.
