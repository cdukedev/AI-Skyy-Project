The Center for Professional Development offers certification and recertification courses for inservice teachers as well as endorsement courses. Six (6) semester hours of college credit to include at least one (1) semester hour in teaching students with disabilities (SWD) must be earned during each renewal period to renew your certificate.
Teacher certification and recertification courses and endorsement courses are offered in weekend and accelerated models. In order to register, you must contact an SOE advisor at soeadvisement@mdc.edu.
Note: All courses in the baccalaureate degree programs are also available to inservice teachers for recertification.
