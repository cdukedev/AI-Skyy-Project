Developing a safe and secure environment where a quality education may be achieved is the responsibility of the entire campus community.  Within our campus community, the Public Safety Departments are committed to its leadership role in developing programs, methods and approaches to assist the institution toward achieving a reasonably safe and secure environment.
The departments exist to support the goals of the college and to assist those who seek and impart knowledge, as well as those who provide support to the mission of the institution.  The departments strive to provide an environment where diverse social, cultural and academic values may prosper and grow.
All members of the departments are expected to be sensitive to the unique nature of the College community and realize they serve to assist the departments and the institution in the achievement of our goals.  It is only through our collective efforts that our mission will be accomplished.
