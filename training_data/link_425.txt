The purpose of evaluation is to investigate and examine programmatic and educational initiatives at the College. New and existing initiatives that have the potential to be scaled to institutional practice are worth understanding. Determining the effects and ultimately the best practices that evolve from a program’s implementation can assist stakeholders in better understanding how or why something works in order to improve upon its utility. Guided by research questions that stakeholders may have about a new or existing initiative, an evaluation can yield formative and summative recommendations for College, State, and Federal stakeholders.
