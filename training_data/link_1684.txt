Miami Dade College engages in ongoing, integrated, and institution-wide research-based planning and evaluation processes that (1) incorporate a systematic review of institutional mission, goals, and outcomes; (2) result in continuing improvement in institutional quality; and (3) demonstrate that the institution is effectively accomplishing its mission.
The Division of Institutional Effectiveness engages the College community in a systematic and strategic process of continuous improvement to fulfill the College’s mission. This engagement not only supports data-driven decision-making at the College but also facilitates the integration of planning, assessment, and research to improve educational programs; administrative support services; academic and student support services; and community/public service.
The Miami Dade College Institutional Effectiveness Model implements and evaluates the College’s mission, vision, and values through regular and systematic planning, assessment, and evaluation at the College, campus, district area, and unit levels.

Planning activities are coordinated by the College-wide Strategic Plan Coordinating Committee, and assessment and evaluation activities are coordinated by the College-wide Institutional Effectiveness Committee. Both committees are supported by the Division of Institutional Effectiveness.
