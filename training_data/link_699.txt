Most days on campus go smoothly without interruption, but there may be times when an emergency takes place on or near campus that requires an evacuation. If this occurs, here are some important things to remember:
 
Individuals with special needs may not be able to evacuate without assistance. If there is someone in your class that is blind, deaf, or whose mobility is restricted by the use of crutches or a walker, simply ask them if they need assistance. Classmates may use the buddy system when evacuating the building.
Elevators may not be working during an emergency. If there is a person who is unable to go down the stairs safely, they should move to the outside area of a stairwell identified as an area of refuge and wait for the Campus Public Safety Department or emergency responders.
When the emergency is over, Public Safety will sound the All Clear message or deliver a live message using the microphone. This will indicate when it is safe to resume normal operations.
Once you have received the All Clear message or Public Safety has communicated that the emergency has ended, you may return to your regularly scheduled classrooms or campus activities.
Let's review: If there is an evacuation, use the stairs, not the elevators. Stay with your groups and do not leave the campus unless instructed. Do not re-enter until you receive an announcement that it is safe to do so. People needing assistance during an evacuation must go to designated areas of refuge for protection in each building to wait for assistance from Public Safety or emergency responders. If you have any questions, or need help, contact your Campus Public Safety Department.
