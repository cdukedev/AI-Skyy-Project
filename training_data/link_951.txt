MDC SOE prides itself on providing meaningful student support throughout the program. In order to be accepted into the B.S programs, the General Knowledge Test, which is the first section of the Florida Teacher Certification Examination, must be taken and passed as per section 1004.04(3)(b)(2) Florida statutes. In order to support the success of our students, MDC SOE provides free workshops for our students in preparation for the General Knowledge Tests (Mathematics and Essay sections) and for the Professional Examination and Subject Area Examinations. Workshops are available at Padron, North, and Kendall campuses. For more information, please contact Dr. Corey Montgomery at cmontgom@mdc.edu.
All baccalaureate degree-seeking students must develop an E-Portfolio. The E-Portfolio contains artifacts that indicate your mastery of the Florida Educator Accomplished Practices (FEAPs) and is developed as you progress through the program and complete assignments. The E-Portfolio has checkpoints during the program to ensure satisfactory progress. Information on the E-Portfolio will be shared with students through in-class presentations. For students needing additional support, arrangements can be made for individualized support through the E-Portfolio Coordinator. Contact us at MDCSOEeportfolio@mdc.edu
