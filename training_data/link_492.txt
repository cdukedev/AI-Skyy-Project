A student financial aid refund is the excess financial aid you can receive after aid has been disbursed and your outstanding balance for tuition and fees have been paid.
Financial aid Refunds are generated twice a week, typically on Monday and Thursday by a nightly scheduled process.
After Refunds are generated in MDConnect student account, the refund file (list of all students expecting refunds) is generated and sent to BTMX, Inc.
The refund preference you selected will determine when your funds are available.
