ATB Testing Request Form
Miami Dade College uses the ACCUPLACER Next-Generation for demonstrating readiness for ATB purposes. The administration must be conducted within a College Board ATB site established for MDC. The reading and writing scores from the ATB administration may be used for placement purposes at MDC. It is important to note that ACCUPLACER Next-Generation (NG) scores from any non-ATB administration, cannot be used for ATB purposes. This includes scores from MDC’s regular ACCUPLACER-NG administrations.
To utilize this feature, all test sessions must be administered by an MDC certified ATB proctor using MDC iBP (internet based proctoring). Remote live proctoring with Examity or Proctortrack are not permitted for ATB purposes.
Test takers must meet or exceed the minimum scores on each of the three approved tests in the chart below.
