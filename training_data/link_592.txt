Student Government Association (SGA) is the voice of the student body. We are responsible for representing and addressing students’ interests and needs. SGA serves as the liaison between the student population and administration. We serve, represent, and advocate for the students. All concerns, suggestions, comments, and solutions are addressed by SGA in a professional manner, so that the faculty and administrators are kept up to date as to what affects the students. As SGA members we promote student involvement and provide leadership training and social interaction while providing the opportunities to attend conferences, retreats and special meetings to exchange ideas with other campuses and colleges across the State of Florida. You can gain valuable skills in civic responsibility, financial management, embracing diversity, serving the community, and interpersonal and cross-cultural communication.
