Students enrolled in an Adult Basic Education (ABE), General Education Development (GED), and English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs must be pre and post-tested with State Board of Education (SBOE) designated assessments. Exceptions may be made for students who are unable to understand or respond to the test due to low literacy, or due to disability.  A pretest must be administered within the first twelve (12) hours of instruction. 
Students without sufficient English proficiency are referred to the Adult English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program.
