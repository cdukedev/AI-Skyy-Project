Assessment plays an integral component of Miami Dade’s institutional effectiveness processes. Ongoing assessment of expected outcomes supports the continuous improvement of the college’s mission.
MDC uses a cyclical process for developing an expected outcome assessment process for Academic Disciplines, Professional Schools and Programs, Student Support Services, and Administrative Support Services Units.
