The hallmark of an excellent teacher preparation program is the number of clinical experience hours served in classrooms. In fact, many programs have shifted to residential programs where students serve in schools full-time throughout their programs. MDC SOE’s courses require many clinical experience hours. Clinical experience is progressive over the program: MDC SOE students start by observing, then move to teaching one or two students, then a small group, then whole class teaching, and finally taking over the class as the student teaching intern. Hours and school settings are determined by the course syllabi. Hours and schools settings are tracked over the course of the program to ensure that MDC SOE students complete clinical experience in all areas of their certifications.
