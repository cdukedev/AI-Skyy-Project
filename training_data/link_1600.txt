All vehicles parked on MDC campuses must have a valid annual parking decal or temporary decal prominently displayed on the rear bumper, or left rear window. Failing to register your vehicle or obtain and prominently display the annual or temporary decal when utilizing College parking may result in the denial of parking privileges or other enforcement measures. Should you have any questions, please contact MDC Public Safety at your campus as listed below.
If you already have a vehicle that is registered with MDC, you only need to affix the new decal you receive in the mail on your car already registered with MDC. If you don't have a registered vehicle, please click Register Your Vehicle below, then select "Add New Vehicle," and register your car. The decal you receive in the mail will be automatically matched to your registered vehicle
If  you are registered in a class that requires you to meets on campus you  will receive your MDC parking decal in the mail. Upon receiving the  parking decal please affix it to your car. You must complete your vehicle registration by clicking the button below. The decal you receive in the mail will then be automatically matched to your registered vehicle.
Students who are only taking MDC Live or MDC Online classes, should  go to the Office of Public Safety and present their MDCard in order to pick up a decal when coming onto campus.				
Students please visit your campus Student Life office, and employees your Public Safety office, for assistance with these issues:
 I haven't received my decal in the mail, and it's been over three weeks since I registered
My decal was lost or stolen
I may have the wrong address on file
Motorcycles
Parking decals for motorcycles may be obtained in person from the Student Life office (students) or Public Safety Department (employees) at your campus. Decals for motorcycles must be affixed on the left rear.
Temporary (Daily) Parking Decal
We understand that circumstances may occur that require students to use another vehicle temporarily to access student services and campus facilities. In this event, daily parking decals may be provided to guests or students as necessary. Public Safety officers at our parking garages/lots or information booths will assist you in obtaining a daily parking decal and providing campus information.
To summarize:

If you already have a vehicle that is registered with MDC, you don't need to do anything else, just affix the new decal you receive on your registered car.
If you don't have a registered vehicle, please click Register Your Vehicle below, then select "Add New Vehicle," and register your car. 
The decal will be automatically matched to your registered vehicle. Students will receive it approximately three weeks after the 100% refund date for the term in which they are registering, and employees will receive it three weeks after the fall term 100% refund date or three weeks after their start date.
Remember to affix your decal on the left rear bumper or left rear window.
Park smart! Know the rules for parking on campus by visiting the Public Safety page.
