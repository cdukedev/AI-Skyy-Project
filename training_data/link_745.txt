The  BLSON Skills Lab serves to provide a dynamic hand on learning environment  geared to enhance the student's clinical skills. While in the lab, procedures  performed will facilitate re-enforcement of the education provided during  lecture and in the clinical setting. The Nursing Skills Lab atmosphere will  equip nursing students with the skills necessary to establish a foundation, in  order to practice safely in the healthcare setting. The Nursing Skills Lab will  permit the development of skills and competencies in courses across the BLSON  curriculum. During the first semester, students will practice basic nursing  care such as assessing vitals, bed making, medication administration, central  line dressing change and utilizing assistive devices to ensure patient safety.  As the student advances in the program, more advanced skills such as Foley  insertion and Tracheostomy care will be integrated using our innovative  technology mannequin, Juno. 
Students  will practice and be evaluated on a variety of skills in the lab, including  adult physical assessment and psychomotor skills. With the use of a human  simulator Juno, the student will be able to practice and demonstrate typical  nursing procedures such as auscultation of heart and lungs, as well as  palpation of pulses. Additionally, students will use a skills trainer, such as  IV arms to familiarize the individual on how to insert an intravenous line. The  BLSON lab also provides Kangaroo pumps to teach nasogastric feeding, wound care  manikins, and Omnicell's which demonstrate the real-life medication  administration process used in healthcare facilities.
