Examinees have an option to pick up a payment form at the Testing and Assessment Department and submit it to the Bursar's Office prior to taking an MDC fee related test or pay online. Do not pay online for any testing fee unless you were notified or instructed to do so by a Testing and Assessment Department related email or employee. The testing fee payment at the Bursar's Office can be made with cash, money order, or credit/debit card. Make sure to save the receipt for proof of payment.

Great news for veterans! The GI Bill offers reimbursement for veterans who take eligible tests, including CLEP and other tests offered at MDC. This means that eligible veterans may schedule a test with MDC, pay the testing fee, take the desired test available, and request reimbursement from the VA. For more information please visit the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website.
