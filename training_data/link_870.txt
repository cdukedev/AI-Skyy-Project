Aviation is a field that starts from the ground up. Before take-off, planes must be prepped, inspected, and guided to the tarmac. Carrying approximately two million passengers per day− or almost one billion people per year− aircraft are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure the safety of its people and cargo. 

                At MDC’s School of Aviation, our accredited degree and certificate programs will prepare students for a career in the field of aviation. Most students who enter the field of aviation administration desire to become air traffic controllers. At MDC, students have the ability to specialize in Air Traffic Control (ATC) via one of the following major concentrations: Aviation Administration, Aviation Maintenance Management, and Professional Pilot Technology. 

                Air traffic controllers are aviation specialists that ensure the safety of more than 60 million aircraft annually across 30.2 million square miles of airspace. They are stationed in air traffic control towers (ATCT) that focus on TRACON, terminal radar approach control, and air route traffic control centers (ARTCC). As one of the highest paying jobs in the nation, competition is high but opportunity is within reach at MDC’s School of Aviation.

Program Details
The School of Aviation at MDC was one of the first FAA-approved AT-CTI programs in the nation. The acronym stands for Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative, which provides candidates with the knowledge and skills needed to become an air traffic controller.

                Compared to non-CTI candidates, students who attend AT-CTI schools have a greater chance of passing their final air traffic controller examination, which involves passing both a ground and air control simulation as well a written section of the exam. At MDC, our air traffic control students train with the same simulations used in Oklahoma City. They are also equipped with the theoretical background and applicable knowledge that is tested weekly in Oklahoma.

                As part of this program, you’ll explore a wide range of aviation areas that include:



Air traffic control and tower operations
Aviation laws and regulations

Customer service
Airport management 




Aviation and airport security
