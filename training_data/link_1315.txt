Welcome to the School of Natural & 
      Social Sciences. You are invited to shape your future with us by "Learning 
      for Earning". We know you'll be worth more when you succeed with us. Some 
      would say that there are three types of people in the world: those who 
      make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who ask "what 
      happened?" We want our students to be the people who make things happen in 
      their lives, in their community, and in their careers through the 
      education and training in which our division excels. Come climb the 
      ladder of success and allow us to help you effectively reach your dreams.
      

      Join us and you will find a schedule of classes that fits your schedule.

Whether you prefer
        morning, afternoon, evening, or weekend classes, or find it best to come
        to school once, twice, three times, or every day of the week, youll
        discover classes that are right for you.

        We offer these classes at locations that are convenient. You can benefit
        from your learning experience at our beautiful North Campus and reflect
        on your discoveries while enjoying the view of our lake. Or perhaps you
        prefer to use the modern facilities of our Hialeah Center or our
        Entrepreneurial Education Center in Liberty City. You can even be
        assured of the same level of instruction at your own workplace or
        agency. Regardless of where you decide to pursue your studies, we
        promise you state-of-the-art facilities and friendly and welcoming
        personnel.

        But most importantly, we promise you professors who are knowledgeable,
        not only about their subject matter, but also about teaching and how
        students learn. Professors who recognize that every student learns
        differently and who address those different learning styles in their
        instructional methods. We want you to experience professors who really
        care about your success, are willing to offer individual help and
        motivate you to excel. In short, professors who place you, the learner,
        at the center of all decision making.
High
        standards with meaningful experiences using up to date technology along
        with lots of student support means youll be setting yourself up for
        success by coming to the School of Natural and Social Sciences at
        Miami-Dade North. And when you succeed here, youll be able to succeed
        anywhere. Our faculty and staff put students success first and our
        programs equip students for higher earning through higher learning.
