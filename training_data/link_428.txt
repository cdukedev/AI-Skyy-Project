Focus groups are a qualitative data collection tool to gather information about perspectives or points of view from a particular group setting. It is used for accessing a broader range of view on a specific topic.
A focus group is constituted by 8 to 10 participants, a facilitator or moderator and the note-taker. Focus groups foster different points of view and perceptions that are used to gather information for discovery, evaluating, bench marking, verifying feelings, opinions and thoughts (Patton, 1990).
At MDC focus groups are useful to investigate the effectiveness of a particular strategy, and to explore new ways to improve processes in the academic and student support services. The purpose of the focus group should be clear and identifiable that qualitative data is the best option.
