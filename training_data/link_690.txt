MDC District Division of Emergency Management considers training an integral part of the preparedness cycle and vital to the success of the overall College mission. As such, Emergency Management promotes and utilizes the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and incident management standards to manage all hazards that may impact the College. To accomplish a unified response under our Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP), we require "Critical and Essential Personnel" to part take in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) emergency management training courses from the Emergency Management Institute (EMI). These courses focus on a national standard for preparedness, prevention, protection, response, and recovery to and from any emergency.
For any questions about these courses or other emergency management training opportunities, please contact the Office of Emergency Management at 305-237-0253.
