Miami Dade College (MDC) supports and encourages research projects to advance scholarly learning and drive data-based initiatives. Research involving students, faculty, or staff at MDC requires official authorization before the study may commence.
At MDC, approval of research project applications is a two-step process: First, MDC's Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews research applications involving human subjects[link]. Once approved by MDC’s IRB, research applications are reviewed by the College Academic and Student Support Council (CASSC) Research & Testing Committee.
Researchers should allow for 6–8 weeks for application reviews. Data collection may not begin until the researcher receives notification that his or her application has been approved by MDC’s IRB and the CASSC Research & Testing Committee.
