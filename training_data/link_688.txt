In October 2018, Miami Dade College was awarded a grant from the Department of Justice's Office of Violence Against Women, leading to the development and staffing of the Miami Dade College Office of Sexual Violence Prevention (OSVP). The Office of Sexual Violence Prevention, a division of the Department of Emergency Management, is overseen by the MDC Coordinated Community Response Team (CCRT). This multidisciplinary team seeks to provide evidence-base programming to reduce sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking in our diverse college community and deliver a safe learning and working environment. The College understands the impact and consequences of sexual violence and strives to create and maintain an educational environment and workplace that is free from such effects.
The Office of Sexual Violence Prevention can provide information on sexual violence awareness and prevention to students and employees. In addition, the OSVP distributes posters, palm cards, and printed materials designed to educate its students and employees about the impact of sexual violence, how to help a friend, and bystander intervention. Additional programs coordinated by the Office of Sexual Violence Prevention include:
MDC Shark Initiative Palm Card 2023
MDC Shark Initiative Brochure 2023
MDC Shark Initiative Sexual Violence Prevention 2023
Stalking Awareness Month Flyer
