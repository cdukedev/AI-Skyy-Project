There are two main GI Bill programs offering education assistance to survivors and dependents of Veterans.
The Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship (Fry Scholarship) is available for children and spouses of Service members who died in the line of duty after September 10, 2001. Full-in state tuition costs covered for training pursued at public institutions. Books and supplies stipend (paid to the student) of up to $1,000 per year. Individuals receive benefits for up to 15 years from the service member’s death, paid for a maximum of 36 months.
The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) Program offers education and training opportunities to eligible dependents of Veterans who are permanently and totally disabled due to a service-related condition or of Veterans who died while on active duty or as a result of a service-related condition. Monthly amount paid directly to the student. Benefits expire 20 years from the service member's date of death, paid for a maximum of 45 months.
You may be eligible for more than one of these programs. In most situations, you will be required to make an irrevocable election between the DEA program and Fry Scholarship when you apply. Beneficiaries are not able to use the same qualifying event for more than one benefit unless you are a child of a Service member that died in the line of duty prior to August 1, 2011.
