An Active Shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use firearms(s) and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims.
Because active shooter situations are often over before law enforcement arrives on the scene, individuals must be ready to respond to an active shooter situation. The MDC is dedicated to the safety of everyone in our community. Officers cannot be everywhere, so we rely on you, our community, to be our eyes and ears. Trust your instincts and report anything that does not seem right. Here we provide some resources to help keep you safe. To that end, please use the resources below to familiar yourself with critical steps to be prepared, informed, and be MDC Ready!
