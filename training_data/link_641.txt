There comes a time for everyone when they reach a point while training that you just want to give up, give it a rest, loss of motivation, etc.. This happens to me every other month. This is when you as an individual have to dig deep, suck it up, and keep moving. A little outside motivation wouldnâ€™t hurt either. I would like to share an essay I came across a few years back, that no matter how many times I read it, it never gets old and always sparks a fire in me. Enjoy!
