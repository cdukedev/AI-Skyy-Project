Licensure is not required in the state of Florida for employment as a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer. However, sonographers may become credentialed by one of the professional credentialing bodies.  Most employers prefer to hire registered sonographers because registration provides an objective measure of an individual’s professional standing. 
Graduates are eligible to apply to take the national certification exams of the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers (ARDMS) in Abdomen, Obstetrics & Gynecology, and Adult Echocardiography.

Successful completion of the MDC level two background check process or  completion of a MDC nursing/health sciences program does not guarantee a  graduate’s eligibility for participation in the professional credentialing  process or for related employment. 
Credentialing agencies and health care  employers may have additional eligibility criteria not required by an  educational institution. Individuals who have been arrested or convicted for  any crime are strongly urged to inquire directly of the licensing board in the  jurisdiction in which they intend to practice.
