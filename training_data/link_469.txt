Each year, Miami Dade College full-time employees are given an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback to their direct supervisor.  Supervisors feedback from employees is assessed using an online, standardized questionnaire provided by MDC, and feedback reports are available to the individual receiving feedback, their supervisors, and their department head.  The Supervisors’ Feedback survey is administered annually by the Human Resources Division.
The Supervisors' Feedback Program provides supervisors with information to help them understand the impact of their actions on the individuals they oversee. It also becomes a source of information for the supervisors’ annual Performance Review.
